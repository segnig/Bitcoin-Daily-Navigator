Here's a standard and well-organized folder structure for your end-to-end data science project on Bitcoin, adaptable for daily or weekly analysis. This structure promotes readability, maintainability, and reusability.

### Explanation of Each Section:

*   **`bitcoin_analysis/`**: This is the root directory of your project.
*   **`data/`**:
    *   **`raw/`**: Store data exactly as you get it. This is crucial for reproducibility. You can't re-scrape or re-API without knowing the original source.
    *   **`processed/`**: Store the data after cleaning, merging, and feature engineering. This is what your models will primarily use.
    *   **`external/`**: For data acquired from sources that aren't directly scraped or via APIs you manage (e.g., downloaded CSVs from a course).
*   **`notebooks/`**: Ideal for iterative exploration and quick experimentation.
    *   Keep notebooks focused. A notebook for EDA should be different from one for training a specific model.
    *   Avoid putting complex logic directly in notebooks; use them to call functions from `src/`.
*   **`src/`**: This is where your production-level Python code lives.
    *   Breaking down into subdirectories (`data_acquisition`, `preprocessing`, `features`, `models`) makes it organized and modular.
    *   `utils/` is for small, helper functions used across different modules.
*   **`models/`**:
    *   **`trained_models/`**: Saves your `.pkl`, `.h5`, or other model file formats.
    *   **`configs/`**: Keeps track of hyperparameters, model architectures, and training parameters.
*   **`reports/`**: Where you document your findings, analyses, and conclusions. This can include generated charts or summaries.
*   **`tests/`**: Essential for robust projects. Write tests to ensure your data processing and model logic work as expected.
*   **`config/`**: Store all configuration settings here, separate from your code. This is good practice, especially for sensitive information like API keys (which should ideally be in environment variables or a `.env` file, not committed to Git).
*   **`README.md`**: The first thing anyone (including future you) will read. Explain the project, how to set it up, and how to run it.
*   **`requirements.txt`**: Generated using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. This lists all Python packages and their versions needed to run your project.

### How to Use This Structure:

1.  **Create the directories:** Make all these folders.
2.  **Populate `src/`:** Write modular Python scripts for each task (scraping, cleaning, feature engineering, modeling).
3.  **Use notebooks for orchestration:** In your notebooks, import functions from your `src/` directory to perform specific tasks. For example, in an EDA notebook, you might import `load_processed_data` from `src/preprocessing` and `plot_time_series` from `src/visualization`.
4.  **Save data and models:** Ensure data is saved to `data/raw/` or `data/processed/` and models to `models/trained_models/`.
5.  **Document:** Fill out the `README.md` and add comments to your code.
6.  **Manage dependencies:** Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` whenever you install or update packages.

This structure will grow with your project, making it easier to manage as you add more complex features and models.
